# Machine-learning:supervised-Learning-Regression Simple Linear Regression
📄 Description:
This project demonstrates the implementation of Simple Linear Regression using Python. It includes a step-by-step explanation of how to predict a dependent variable based on one independent variable.

📊 What’s Inside:
Importing required libraries (NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn)

Loading and exploring the dataset

Data visualization (scatter plot, regression line)

Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets

Training the Linear Regression model

Making predictions

Evaluating the model performance (Mean Squared Error, R² Score)

🎯 Objective:
To understand the basic concept of supervised learning and how Simple Linear Regression can be used for predictive analysis.
